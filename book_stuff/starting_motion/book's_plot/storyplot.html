<h3 id="kertelasacharacter">Kertel as a Character</h3>
<p>Kertel will be a bit of a push over at the start, but i'll try to add some character development on that regard.</p>
<p>My objective with him is to try and depict someone who stopped following their desire and instead keeps doing what others tell them to.</p>
<p>For that he'll have to be displaying a overreliance on his other personality's when it comes to making quick or hard choices, letting the one that screams the hardest take control. Those fights for control aren't going to favor Kertel(Blue) because of his calm and mostly logic driven Character.</p>

<h3 id="kertelintro">Kertel Intro</h3>
<p>From the start of the story I'll have to make it clear trough the way I write that Kertel has multiple personality's without outright telling the reader about it. For that I'll use a dialog similar to the dialog of Percy Jackson part 2 (idk why I never finished the first book but I liked the way it was written, witch gives me another reason to return to that book), where the reader sees the action happening in the book from a higher perspective instead of the perspective of one single character in the story.</p>
